What is CSSOM?
CSSOM stands for:
Cascading Style Sheets Object Model

It is the object representation of CSS, just like DOM is the object representation of HTML.

🔹 Simple Definition

HTML → converted into DOM
CSS → converted into CSSOM

Then:
DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree → Layout → Paint

This is how a webpage appears on screen.

How Browser Builds CSSOM
When browser reads CSS:
                                      body {
                                        background-color: blue;
                                      }
                                      
                                      p {
                                        color: red;
                                      }

It parses it and builds a tree-like structure internally. Something like this conceptually:

                                    CSSStyleSheet
                                     ├── Rule: body
                                     │     └── background-color: blue
                                     └── Rule: p
                                           └── color: red
That structure is CSSOM.

Full Rendering Flow
When page loads:

Step 1️⃣ Parse HTML → Build DOM
Step 2️⃣ Parse CSS → Build CSSOM
Step 3️⃣ Combine DOM + CSSOM → Create Render Tree
Step 4️⃣ Layout (calculate positions)
Step 5️⃣ Paint pixels
